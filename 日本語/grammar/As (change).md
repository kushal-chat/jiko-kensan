## につれて

～につれて is often used in situations where there is a proportional relationship with the two events in the respective clauses.

==都心化（が進む）につれて自分の地域への関心が薄うすれる。==
As urbanization progresses, the concern towards one’s region fades.

==冬になるにつれて、山が白くなってくる。==
The mountains become white as winter arrives.

## に従って

～に従って can be used in a hierarchical sense to mean “according to”. 

==私の合図に従って行動してください。==
Please act in according to my signals.

==郷に入っては郷に従え。==

### Nuance

The contrast in nuance between ～につれて and ～にしたがって can definitely be seen in the following example.

==スタジアムで場内の歓声が高まる｛につれて・にしたがって｝。実況アナウンサーの声も大きくなっていった。==
As the cheers in the stadium intensified, the commentator’s voice got ever louder.

With ～につれて, the suspense is captured with the first clause being the trigger for the events of the second. With ～にしたがって, the sentence doesn’t become ungrammatical, but it loses the emotive drive and merely states that the two events described in the respective clauses are happening in parallel. 

## に伴って

伴う means “to accompany” and ～に伴って means “associated/accompanied with” or “as”. Just like ～につれて, it may show that something is happening together with a change/transition of a certain situation. There is a temporal context of “**taking A as the opportunity, therefore…B**”.  It is also often the case that it infers that the thing in the second clause continues.

==汚染に伴う問題について話しましょう。==
Let’s talk about the problems accompanied with pollution.

==人口の増加に伴って、たくさんの住宅が建てられる。==
Many houses are constructed in association to the increase in population.

==駅ビルの再整備に伴い撤去されましたが、5年ぶりに広島駅に戻ってきました。==
It was removed due to the redevelopment of the station building, but it has returned to Hiroshima Station after five years.

## とともに

～とともに also behaves like ～につれて to show that something happens together with a change/transition of a certain situation. However, unlike ～につれて, the entire sentence doesn’t necessarily have to show a state of progress. In other cases it can have meanings equivalent to 同時に and 一緒に. As for its usage similar to ～につれて, it’s also the case that the words it follows must show change in situation. It cannot be words pertaining to action, which ～につれ and ～にしたがって can be.   

==子供が卒業するとともに、父母会も解散しました。==
The parents’ association also dissolved at the same time the kids graduated.

## ～に応じて

～に応じて means “accordingly” or “as to”. The first meaning is important in this lesson as it ties with the other patterns. When it is used with a verb that shows change, it describes the corresponding/dealing with a certain change. In this instance, it is possible to switch it out with ～につれて, ～にしたがって, ～にともなって, and ～とともに. 

==住民の要求に応じて、説明会を開くことになりました。==
In meeting the wants of the citizens, it has been decided that we open an information seminar.

## ～に応えて

The 一段 verb 応える may be used to mean “to come through/satisfy/answer” or “to tell/go to one’s heart”. The latter usage shows some sort of burden. 

==期待に応える。==
To come through with expectations.

==要求に応えて、社員の給料が上がりました。==
To meet demand, the employee’s salaries went up.
