## となる

The result of によって or an action.

となる is similar to the much more common になる form, but there are a few differences:

- となる is typically only used with nouns
- It usually implies 'finality' or 'uniqueness' in the change or situation described, where になる can be used to describe any change at any time, no matter how often it might recur. (So となる could not be used with time expressions such as 七時になる, for example.)
- It tends to convey a formal tone
