## ～（の）うえで

～（の）うえで attaches to the 連体形 of verbs or to nouns to give a meaning of “on the occasion of”. Following it, a discussion concerning a point of concern is expected. Giving an explanation of a circumstance, it shows opinion/thought on an issue. When giving a meaning of ～ときに, ～際に and ～に際して become possible as well.  

==時間を守るということは、仕事｛をする｝**うえで**最低限のマナーである。==
Being punctual in the process of work is the minimum of manner.

The event A is “continuing one’s studies”. The B can’t be just a statement of explanation. Rather, it must be a point of concern: 注意点、問題点, 重要ポイント, 必要条件, etc.

==研究を続ける**うえで**、中国に留学したほうがいいと判断した。==
I have concluded that it is best for me to study abroad in China on the basis of continuing my studies.

Although the first sentence meets the grammatical needs of using ～うえで, it is very unnatural at best because of style conflict. When rephrased to fix this, the unnaturalness goes away. Another major grammatical difference is that ～うえで is not limited to special circumstances like ～に際してand ～に当たって are. In such case, ～うえで becomes the only option, and as a consequence, is even common in the spoken language in this regard.

==十分に事件を勘案した**うえで**返事します。==
I will reply after sufficiently considering the matter.

## にあたって

Another thing to note is that ～にあたって is dynamic whereas ～に際して is static. ～にあたって comes from 当たる, so a meaning of “coping/grasping with” is hidden. 際, which is also read as きわ in other instances, refers to when you have no choice but to put up with an extraordinary time of some sort.

==実験**にあたって**は、事故を起こさないように注意してください。==
Please be careful to not cause an accident on the experiment.

### Nuance

～うえで is extremely indicative of the written language, which is not a characteristic of ～にあたって. For reiteration, ～うえで is used when stating a situation where “an important A, in the course from before you start it and till it ends, B may occur” and there is a “point of interest/necessary condition” that follows (the B). 

## ～に臨んで & ～に面して

To finish off this lesson, consider the following speech modals: ～に臨んで, ～に面して.

 Aに臨んで	 On the occasion of participation in a positive/negative A…
 Aに面して	 On the occasion of an extreme, negative situation A faced…

They are basically interchangeable in emergency situations. Aに臨んで, however, shows that one is participating in an event A, whether it being present in that scene, going to such place, or forwarding oneself on.

Oppositely, ～に面して shows that one is suddenly or passively faced with a situation. So, with crisis situations concerning things like war, failure, etc., it is often the case that the former would demonstrate a strong person in spite of the crisis and the latter would give images of a weak person in the upset.   

==母親の急死に｛臨んで・面して｝、それまで仲のよかった兄たちは、諍いさかいを始めた。==
In **facing** our mother’s sudden death, my older brothers who had been cordial up till then began a quarrel.

==経済的危機に｛〇面しても、X臨んでも｝、冷静に適切な行動のとれる人を尊敬しています。==
I respect those that take the appropriate actions calmly even while **facing** economic crisis.

==第一試合に｛〇臨んで・X面して｝、緊張を隠しきれなかった。==
I couldn’t completely hide my nervousness in **facing** the first match.
