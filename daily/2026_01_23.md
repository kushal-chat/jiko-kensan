Today I studied DeepEval in depth. I emphasized understanding of the six agentic metrics, covered component-level as well as end-to-end metrics, 
and took notes in my technical notebook on real code examples. I also took a quick look at the other things included in DeepEval, for example 
pytest connections and things relating to GEval and DAG.

I also looked into HayekMAS and read the Baum papers on a high level. I found the part about BlocksWorld interesting. 
I also read the Zenn hackathon first place winner.

I looked into some Torch things to learn. PyTorch is extremely useful but at the end of the day I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to build
the entire thing from scratch in TinyTorch. It's more useful to experiment with Torch and follow blogs to build small projects that add to one another.
I think it may be a solid investment to use FunctionGemma and VLMs on a robot. I liked some blogs I found online, and I want to play around with them.

I want to build on previous work that I've done, but it's very difficult since there's no clear line demarcating when I dive too deep into something and 
when it's not deep enough. And at the end of the day, I think no matter how much I know, perfectionism is a very tall wall to climb over. I want to
be okay with not being fully perfect. 

I also want to ensure I pass the G検定 whether now or later, but everything takes time.
